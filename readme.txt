This project is made for build a own breakout hardware to use with Raspberry Pi:

- hw directory: schematics for build the pcb.
- test benches for check breakout hardware.
	breakout_testbench.py programmed in python.
	breakout_testbench.sh programmed in bash shell.
	
List GPIOs:

GPIO4: output CLK
GPIO23: output green led
GPIO24: output red led
GPIO25: input
